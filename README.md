## React Fundamentals Utilized  

- **Components & Props**: Modularized components for reusability.  
- **State Management**: `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for handling dynamic state and lifecycle events.  
- **Routing**: `react-router-dom` for routing and navigation between different pages.  
- **Conditional Rendering**: Display different UI elements based on user actions and states.  
- **Context API**: Used for global state management across components (Cart and Wishlist).

## Data Handling & Management  

- **Context API**:  
   - Used to manage cart and wishlist data globally across the application.  
   - Ensures state consistency without prop drilling.
